This is a program I made for finding the lyrics of a song based on AZLyrics.
Here is how it works:

・Before you run it, change the "song" variable to a song you want to find the lyrics for.

・It will search on AZLyrics for this specific song and print
the lyrics for the top result based on the given song's name. If the song you
searched for is not that popular and they are other songs with the same name,
it may not print the right lyrics.

・For more info about how it works you can see find_lyrics.py.

Feel free to use it :)
